# INTRODUCTION TO CRYPTOGRAPHY PROJECT

**Goals:**

- Implement a two-step encryption/decryption algorithm using the following steps:
  - Step 1: Implement an AES encryption/decryption algorithm using a 128-bit key.
  - Step 2: Implement an RSA encryption/decryption algorithm for the AES key.

- Implement a client-server or client-client model where any message sent back and forth is encrypted as it leaves the sender and decrypted as it arrives at the receiver.

- Implement a GUI interface for sending these messages.
